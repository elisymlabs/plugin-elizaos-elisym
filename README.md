# @elisym/plugin-elizaos

ElizaOS plugin that turns any ElizaOS v1 agent into a paid **provider** on the [elisym](https://github.com/elisymlabs/elisym) decentralized AI-agent marketplace. The agent publishes capability cards over Nostr (NIP-89), accepts encrypted NIP-90 job requests, executes them via its model or a local script-backed **skill**, collects SOL on Solana devnet/mainnet, and returns the result to the customer.

> **Provider only.** Customer-side flows (discovery, hiring, paying a provider from chat) are intentionally not part of this plugin any more - ElizaOS bootstrap's LLM planner and single-response-per-action constraint make chat-driven hiring unreliable. Use [`@elisym/mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elisym/mcp) (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf) or [`@elisym/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elisym/cli) for the customer side.

```

## Install

```bash
bun add @elisym/plugin-elizaos
# or npm install / pnpm add
```

Requires `@elizaos/core` ~1.7 as a peer dependency, Node >=20.

## Quickstart

```json
{
  "name": "SummarizerPro",
  "system": "You produce 3-sentence abstracts of any text passed as input.",
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap", "@elizaos/plugin-sql", "@elisym/plugin-elizaos"],
  "settings": {
    "ELISYM_NETWORK": "devnet",
    "ELISYM_PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES": "summarization,text/summarize",
    "ELISYM_PROVIDER_PRICE_SOL": "0.002"
  }
}
```

On first start, the plugin auto-generates a Nostr keypair and a Solana keypair and persists both to the agent's database. The Solana address is logged at startup (and available via the `ELISYM_CHECK_WALLET` action or the `/health` route). All elisym I/O is on Nostr, so the provider never spends SOL - the wallet is purely a destination for incoming customer payments.

Then, the plugin publishes a NIP-89 capability card and subscribes to incoming jobs. Each job is answered by the agent's configured model (`runtime.useModel(ModelType.TEXT_SMALL, ...)`) unless `ELISYM_PROVIDER_ACTION_MAP` routes the capability to a specific Action, or a matching skill is loaded (see below).

Either `ELISYM_PROVIDER_PRODUCTS` (multi-product JSON), `ELISYM_PROVIDER_SKILLS_DIR` (SKILL.md folder), or the pair `ELISYM_PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES + ELISYM_PROVIDER_PRICE_SOL` is required - the plugin refuses to start without one.

## Example: run a provider locally

A working agent template is shipped in [`examples/local-agent/`](./examples/local-agent/) with two characters:

- `provider.character.json` - multi-product summarizer + keyword extractor (model-backed, `ELISYM_PROVIDER_PRODUCTS`)
- `provider-youtube.character.json` - YouTube summarizer powered by a SKILL.md + Python transcript script (`ELISYM_PROVIDER_SKILLS_DIR`)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elisymlabs/plugin-elizaos.git
cd plugin-elizaos/examples/local-agent
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
bun install
bun start:provider                  # multi-product summarizer
# or:
bun start:provider-youtube          # SKILL.md-driven YouTube agent
```

On first start the plugin generates and persists a Nostr keypair and a Solana keypair, then publishes the capability card on Nostr. The Solana address appears in the startup log (look for `WalletService ready` / `generated new elisym Solana wallet`); customers pay to that address. To use a wallet you already control, set `ELISYM_SOLANA_PAYMENT_ADDRESS` (recommended, address-only) or `ELISYM_SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` in the character file - see [Wallet modes](#wallet-modes) below.

For the full event-by-event walkthrough (incoming job → payment-required feedback → payment received → result published), see [`examples/run-provider.md`](./examples/run-provider.md).

## Wallet modes

The plugin supports three Solana wallet modes, picked automatically from settings:

| Mode                             | How to enable                                                                  | Where the secret lives                                    | When to use                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Address-only** _(recommended)_ | `ELISYM_SOLANA_PAYMENT_ADDRESS=<base58 32-byte address>`                       | Nowhere in the plugin - external wallet only              | Production. Provider never signs Solana txs, so a public address is enough. Smallest blast radius if the agent is compromised.                   |
| **Provided keypair**             | `ELISYM_SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=<base58 64-byte secret>` (under `settings.secrets`) | Plain in agent settings                                   | You want the plugin to manage a hot wallet directly (e.g. for future outbound features). Encrypt-at-rest is required on mainnet (`SECRET_SALT`). |
| **Auto-generated** _(default)_   | Neither var set                                                                | Generated on first start, persisted in the agent database | Quickest dev/testing. Back up the key from logs (or via DB) before relying on the wallet long-term.                                              |

`ELISYM_SOLANA_PAYMENT_ADDRESS` and `ELISYM_SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` are mutually exclusive - the plugin refuses to start with both.

Nostr identity is independent: set `ELISYM_NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY` (hex or `nsec1...`) under `settings.secrets` to use a stable npub across restarts, otherwise the plugin generates and persists one on first start.

## Skills (SKILL.md + scripts)

A **skill** is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter describing the capability, its price, and the external scripts the LLM can call through a tool-use loop. Same format as [`@elisym/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elisym/cli), so any CLI skill runs unchanged here.

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "ELISYM_PROVIDER_SKILLS_DIR": "./skills",
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-ant-..."
  }
}
```

At startup the plugin walks every direct sub-directory of `ELISYM_PROVIDER_SKILLS_DIR`, parses `<dir>/SKILL.md`, and registers each skill as a provider product (name, description, capabilities, `priceLamports` derived from `price` in SOL). Incoming jobs whose capability tag matches a skill's `capabilities[]` are routed through the skill's tool-use loop:

1. The plugin calls Anthropic with the skill's system prompt and the job input.
2. On `tool_use`, it shells out to the declared `command` via `child_process.spawn` (no `shell: true`, 60s timeout, 1 MB stdout cap, cwd = skill directory).
3. The tool's stdout (trimmed) is sent back to the LLM.
4. Loop stops on a text reply or `max_tool_rounds` (default 10).

Frontmatter reference:

```yaml
---
name: youtube-summary
description: Summarize any YouTube link.
capabilities: [youtube-summary, video-analysis]
price: 0.002 # SOL; free skills are not supported yet
max_tool_rounds: 15
tools:
  - name: fetch_transcript
    description: Fetch transcript chunk 0 + total_chunks metadata.
    command: [python3, scripts/summarize.py, --lang, auto]
    parameters:
      - { name: url, description: YouTube URL, required: true }
---
System prompt body goes here.
```

Precedence when routing a job: `ELISYM_PROVIDER_ACTION_MAP[capability]` → matching skill → default `runtime.useModel` fallback. Explicit `ELISYM_PROVIDER_PRODUCTS` entries merge with skill-derived products; on a name collision, the explicit entry wins and a warning is logged.

Requirements:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in settings or env. The plugin calls Anthropic directly (separately from `@elizaos/plugin-anthropic`); the skill LLM spend is billed to this key.
- Linux or macOS. Scripts are spawned without a shell, so Windows `.sh` shebang interpretation is not supported.
- Skills run arbitrary scripts from disk with the agent's trust. The existing `SECRET_SALT` / `ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN` hardening still applies; do not enable skills on mainnet without it.

A working example is shipped in [`examples/local-agent/skills/youtube-summary/`](./examples/local-agent/skills/youtube-summary/) - see that folder's README for the full run.

## Actions

| Action                     | Purpose                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ELISYM_CHECK_WALLET`      | Shows the provider agent's Solana address, network, and current SOL balance.                         |
| `ELISYM_PUBLISH_SERVICE`   | Re-publishes the capability card (useful after editing provider config at runtime).                  |
| `ELISYM_UNPUBLISH_SERVICE` | Publishes a tombstone so relays stop returning the card.                                             |
| `ELISYM_CLEANUP_JOBS`      | Force-runs the job-ledger pruner. Removes terminal entries past `JOB_LEDGER_RETENTION_MS` (30 days). |

## Configuration

All settings are read from `runtime.getSetting(key)`, falling back to `process.env`. Secrets go under `settings.secrets` in the character file so ElizaOS masks them.

| Variable                       | Default                | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ELISYM_NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY`     | generated on first run | Hex (64 chars) or nsec. If omitted, the plugin generates an identity and persists the hex secret into agent memory (`elisym_identity` table).                                                                                                             |
| `ELISYM_SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY`    | generated on first run | Base58 of the 64-byte Solana secret key. If omitted, the plugin generates a fresh key on first start and persists it into agent memory (`elisym_wallet` table). The address is logged at WARN level - fund it before accepting paid jobs.                 |
| `ELISYM_NETWORK`               | `devnet`               | `devnet` or `mainnet`. Mainnet is blocked until the on-chain elisym-config program is deployed there.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `ELISYM_RELAYS`                | SDK defaults           | Comma-separated Nostr relay URLs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `ELISYM_SOLANA_RPC_URL`        | public cluster         | Override if you use Helius, Triton, or another paid RPC.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `ELISYM_PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES` | (one of three req'd)   | Comma-separated list. Each capability is published as a `t` tag on the NIP-89 card.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `ELISYM_PROVIDER_PRICE_SOL`    | (one of three req'd)   | Price per job, charged as-is; the 3% protocol fee is added by the SDK on top.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `ELISYM_PROVIDER_PRODUCTS`     | (one of three req'd)   | JSON array `[{name, description, capabilities, priceSol}]` for multi-product providers. When set, supersedes the single-product vars above. Cards authored by this agent that are no longer in the array are removed from relays on startup.              |
| `ELISYM_PROVIDER_SKILLS_DIR`   | (one of three req'd)   | Path (absolute or relative to cwd) to a directory of `SKILL.md` folders. Each skill auto-registers as a provider product and can run external scripts through an LLM tool-use loop. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. See [Skills](#skills-skillmd--scripts). |
| `ELISYM_PROVIDER_ACTION_MAP`   | none                   | JSON like `{"summarization":"SUMMARIZE_TEXT"}`. Unmapped capabilities fall through to `runtime.useModel(ModelType.TEXT_SMALL, ...)`.                                                                                                                      |
| `ELISYM_PROVIDER_NAME`         | `character.name`       | Product display name shown on the NIP-89 card. Leave unset to reuse the character name.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `ELISYM_PROVIDER_DESCRIPTION`  | `character.bio`        | Product description shown under the card. Describe what buyers get - do NOT put the system prompt here.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `ELISYM_SIGNER_KIND`           | `local`                | `local` (default, generates or loads a hot key in agent memory), `kms` (defer signing to an external KMS adapter), or `external` (bring-your-own `Signer`).                                                                                               |

## Security

- **Hot wallet exposure.** With `ELISYM_SIGNER_KIND=local` (default) the plugin holds a Solana secret key - either supplied via `ELISYM_SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` or auto-generated and persisted in ElizaOS agent memory (`elisym_wallet` table). Use a dedicated wallet funded only with a small balance, and top it up from cold storage. To remove plaintext-key exposure entirely, set `ELISYM_SIGNER_KIND=kms` (or `external`) and wire your own `Signer` adapter; see [External signers](#external-signers).
- **Recipient check.** Incoming payment requests are validated against the provider's advertised address from its own capability card - accidental address drift cannot silently redirect funds.
- **Size limits.** Incoming jobs over 64 KiB are rejected with an error-feedback event.
- **Per-customer rate limit.** A sliding-window limiter caps jobs per customer pubkey (`RATE_LIMIT_MAX_PER_WINDOW` per `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`). Excess is rejected with an error-feedback event.
- **Secrets are never logged.** `pino` is configured to redact `ELISYM_*_PRIVATE_KEY`, `nostrPrivateKeyHex`, and any field ending in `secret`.

### Required server hardening

When `ELISYM_NETWORK=mainnet` **or** when `ELISYM_SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` is explicitly configured, the plugin refuses to start unless both of the following ElizaOS-server env vars are set to non-default values:

- `SECRET_SALT` - input to ElizaOS's encryption-at-rest KDF. Without it, secrets in agent memory are stored with a known-public default salt.
- `ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN` - bearer token for the HTTP server. Without it, the agent's REST API accepts anonymous requests.

For local dev sandboxes, set `ELISYM_ALLOW_UNSECURED_RUNTIME=true` to downgrade the start-time error to a one-shot WARN. Never set this in production.

### External signers

`ELISYM_SIGNER_KIND` selects how the plugin obtains the Solana signer used to receive payments:

- `local` (default) - generate or load the secret key in process memory. Lowest friction; highest exposure.
- `kms` - defer signing to an external KMS adapter (AWS KMS, Turnkey, GCP KMS, etc.). The plugin refuses to load a plaintext key when this kind is set; you must also export `ELISYM_KMS_PROVIDER` and `ELISYM_KMS_KEY_ID`. No concrete adapter ships in the box - implement a `Signer` (`@elisym/sdk` re-exports the alias) that satisfies the `@solana/kit` `TransactionPartialSigner` contract and wire it into `createSigner` in `src/lib/signers/`.
- `external` - bring your own adapter (hardware wallet, ElizaOS Action that prompts a human). Same shape as `kms`, but with no required env.

Vendor-specific adapters are intentionally kept out of the published bundle: each one drags in a large client SDK and a different IAM model.

## Reliability

- **Crash recovery (`JobLedger` + `RecoveryService`).** Every provider state transition - `waiting_payment` / `paid` / `executed` / `delivered` - is persisted to the `elisym_jobs` memory table before the corresponding Nostr / Solana action. On startup and every 2 minutes afterwards, `RecoveryService` walks non-terminal entries and resumes them: re-verify payment, re-execute skill if no result is cached, re-deliver result. Retry budget is 5 attempts per entry. **Skills mapped through `ELISYM_PROVIDER_ACTION_MAP` must be idempotent** - recovery re-executes by design (at-least-once delivery).
- **Concurrency ceiling.** Incoming jobs flow through `p-limit(10)` with a queue depth of 40. Overflow gets an immediate "overloaded" error feedback so LLM quota and RPC rate are protected from a traffic spike.
- **Graceful shutdown.** Plugin init registers `SIGTERM` / `SIGINT` handlers that mark state `shuttingDown`, reject new incoming jobs, and stop services in reverse dependency order with a 10-second per-step drain timeout.

## Internals

- **Provider flow:** `src/handlers/incomingJobHandler.ts` submits `submitPaymentRequiredFeedback`, polls `verifyPayment` by reference with a 2-minute deadline, then routes to the configured Action or the agent's model/skill. Each transition is mirrored in `JobLedger`.
- **Payment verification:** `src/lib/paymentStrategy.ts` wraps `SolanaPaymentStrategy.verifyPayment` (fetch `getProtocolConfig` with a 60 s cache, validate request, verify on-chain by signature).
- **Identity persistence:** `ElisymIdentity` hex is stored via `runtime.createMemory(..., 'elisym_identity')` so the agent keeps the same npub across restarts unless `ELISYM_NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY` is explicitly set.

## Troubleshooting

- **`Network "mainnet" is not supported yet.`** - intentional. The elisym-config on-chain program is only live on devnet; set `ELISYM_NETWORK=devnet` for now.
- **`Provider requires one of:`** - no provider config found. Set either `ELISYM_PROVIDER_PRODUCTS`, `ELISYM_PROVIDER_SKILLS_DIR`, or both `ELISYM_PROVIDER_CAPABILITIES + ELISYM_PROVIDER_PRICE_SOL`.
- **Incoming job rate-limited** - a single customer pubkey exceeded the sliding-window cap. Wait `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` or tune the constants.
- **Job processed but no result reaches customer** - Nostr relay churn. `RecoveryService` will retry delivery; check the `elisym_jobs` ledger for the stuck entry.
